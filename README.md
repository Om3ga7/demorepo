## Repo Instructions

Getting Git repository set up:
1) either choose or create a new file for the repository. Make it easy to find.
2) create a new repo or choose an existing one on Github.
3) copy the https of the repo on Github.
4) open your IDE or text-editor and navigate to the terminal.
5) from the terminal window, enter "py -3.9".
6) from there enter "git clone" and paste in the https and hit enter.
7) from the side-bar of the project, you should be able to see that the 
project READ-ME can be found along with other supporting documents. 

* You can use "git status" in the terminal to see any modifications or changes 
to the code but haven't been saved to a commit yet.
* If there are any files that have not yet been added that you wish to add, you 
can use "git add ." or "git add ___.___" using the file name that you wish to track.
* To add a commit to the repository using "git commit -m". The "m" stands for message
which you need if you are going to commit your files. Use the name of the file after 
-m and then use "added ___.___"
* Lastly to push a repo, just enter "git push".
